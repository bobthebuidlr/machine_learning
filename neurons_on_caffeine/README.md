# A Neural Network Library built from scratch
This project is to setup a neural network dynamically, by being able to add layers on the go, having freedom on choosing the number of nodes etc. The calculations for feedforward and backpropagation are also based on dynamic input, which makes this algorithm work for even more complex neural networks.
