# Basic Neural Network from Scratch

In this repo I have created a standard and basic Neural Network library. This was done to improve understanding of the calculations done at several layers within a neural network, and to grasp the idea better.

## Functionality

Neural Network can now only be initialized with 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer. The operations that can be performed on the NN is feedfoward() for prediction, and train() to train the model.

The Matrix library includes the basic forms of matrix operations, such as add(), subtract(), dot_product(), scale(), transpose()
